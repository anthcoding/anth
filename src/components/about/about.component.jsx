            I am a junior frontend web developer who invests a great deal of
            time on learning the most recent utmost technologies. I love
            designing websites, that is where I find the most satisfying
            challenges as that is how my creativeness rolls out.
            <br />
            Besides coding, youâ€™ll find me reading some books, playing my
            guitar, and jogging all across the city with loud music on my
            headphones...
